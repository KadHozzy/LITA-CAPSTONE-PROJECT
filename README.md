# MY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT JOURNEY @ LITA

# Sales Performance and Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I focused on two main areas:

1. **Sales Performance Analysis** for a retail store
2. **Customer Segmentation** for a subscription-based service

The goal was to dive into each dataset to find insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance. To achieve this, I used SQL, Excel, and Power BI to analyze the data and visualize my findings.

## Data Source

For this project, I worked with two main datasets:
- **Sales Data**: Details on transactions, products, regions, and revenue.
- **Customer Data**: Information about customers, their subscriptions, revenues, start and end dates, and cancellation statuses.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Server**: I used SQL queries to explore, clean, and transform data, extracting key insights directly from the database.
- **Excel**: I started by loading the data into Excel for initial exploration. With pivot tables, I summarized metrics like total sales by product, region, and month.
- **Power BI**: Finally, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the findings and enable further exploration.

## Steps I Followed

### Step 1: Data Preparation

I began by loading both datasets into SQL Server. After some basic data cleaning and setting up relationships, I was able to generate some calculated fields that would help with my analysis, like subscription duration.

In Excel, I set up a few additional calculations, such as average sales per product and monthly trends. This gave me a quick overview of what the data looked like before diving into detailed queries.

### Step 2: SQL Analysis

Using SQL queries, I focused on several key questions, such as:
- What are the top-selling products and highest-revenue regions?
- How many transactions occurred in each region?
- For the subscription data, I explored questions like which subscription type was the most popular and how long on average customers stayed subscribed.

The SQL analysis helped me zero in on trends and segments to focus on in Power BI.

### Step 3: Building the Power BI Dashboard

With the insights I gained in SQL, I moved to Power BI to create a dynamic dashboard. I visualized the key metrics:
- **Sales Performance**: Showing top products, revenue trends by region, and sales over time.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Displaying trends by subscription type, regional breakdowns, and active vs. canceled subscriptions.

Adding slicers to the dashboard allowed me to make it more interactive, so users can filter by subscription status, region, and other key metrics.

## Key Insights and Results

Through this project, I discovered valuable insights, such as:
1. **Sales Trends**: Certain products performed better in specific regions, and sales were higher in some months, showing seasonal demand.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: A few subscription types were significantly more popular, and the majority of cancellations happened within the first six months, suggesting a need to improve customer retention.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to practice data analysis end-to-endâ€”from exploring the data in Excel and SQL to visualizing findings in Power BI. By integrating these tools, I was able to uncover and present insights that could help inform business decisions in a retail and subscription context.
